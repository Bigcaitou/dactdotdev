`In fact, research reveals that the painting is called “the difficulties of life” in the art world, and it’s a nationwide Congolese staple.  You can see this scene painted in a lot of different styles, but always with these same elements and characters—always telling the same, recognizable tale.  It’s been done by very famous Congolese artists from the Western region, like Ndabagera, whose copy I have playfully defaced with commentary above, or by less-well-known artists, like Materesi, the local  artist in the rural area of Eastern Congo where I grew up, pictured working here in the late 80s.`
